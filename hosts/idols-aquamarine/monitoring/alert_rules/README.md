# Alert Rules

Alert rules are configurations that define conditions, scope, and actions for generating alerts from
monitored signals, such as metrics, logs, or activity. When an alert rule's defined conditions are
met for a specific resource within its scope, the system generates a triggered alert, which is the
actual instance of the condition being met. These rules specify the data to monitor, the trigger
threshold, and the resulting actions, like sending notifications to specific receivers or performing
automated tasks.
