# Zerotier - your own private network(VPN)
#
# It's open source and free for personal use,
# and it's really easy to setup and use.
# Zerotier has great client coverage for Linux, windows, Mac, android, and iOS.
# Zerotier is more mature and stable compared to other alternatives such as netbird/netmaker.
# Maybe I'll give netbird/netmaker a try when they are more mature, but for now, I'm sticking with Zerotier.
