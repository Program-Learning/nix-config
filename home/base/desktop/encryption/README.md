# Encryption

We have GnuPG & password-store installed by default, mainly for password management, authentication & communication encryption.

We also have LUKS2 for disk encryption on Linux, and [rclone](https://rclone.org/crypt/) for cross-platform data encryption & syncing.

[Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) may be more general for file encryption.

[Sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops/tree/main) can be used for file encryption too, if you prefer 
using a Cloud provider for key management.
